Roguelike Game (GML)

A roguelike game built using GameMaker Language (GML), where players control a mage and battle through randomly spawned waves of enemies in a central tower. Features include:

    Player-controlled mage: Move and fight with auto-attacks using projectiles.
    Dynamic enemy waves: Enemies spawn and increase in difficulty with each wave.
    Upgrade system: Collect coins dropped by enemies to purchase upgrades and enhance your abilities.
    XP and leveling: Gain XP by defeating enemies and choose from 3 upgrade options when leveling up.
    Boss battles: Face powerful bosses at certain levels.
    Shop: Use currency to unlock special upgrades separate from level-ups.

This project is in active development and will evolve with more content, enemy variety, and sound effects.
