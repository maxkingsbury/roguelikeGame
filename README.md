# Roguelike Game (name to be determined)

A roguelike game built using GameMaker Language (GML), where players control a mage and battle through randomly spawned waves of enemies. 

Features include:
- Player-controlled character: Move and fight with auto-attacks using projectiles
  
- Dynamic enemy waves: Enemies spawn and increase in difficulty with each wave

- Upgrade system: Collect coins dropped by enemies to buy upgrades

- XP and leveling: Gain XP by defeating enemies and choose from 3 upgrade options when leveling up
  
- Shop: Use currency to unlock special upgrades and weapons; separate from level-ups.


This project is only really a partial product and will likely remain that way.
